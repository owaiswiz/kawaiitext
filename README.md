# KawaiiText

## What is this ?
Its a ruby gem to render your text to an image with fancy fonts and some effects with backgrounds. Might be suitable if
you ever had to generate these kind of things automatically for using them as cover or
header images. It makes use of ImageMagick for all image manipulations

## Why does this exist ?
I had a need for something like this for a project of mine and wasn't able to find anything that fit my usecase.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'kawaii_text'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install kawaii_text

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
